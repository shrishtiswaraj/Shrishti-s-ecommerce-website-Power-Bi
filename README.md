Project Learnings: Online Sales Dashboard
Overview
This project focuses on the creation of an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze online sales data. Leveraging Power BI,
the dashboard employs various visualization techniques, including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, 
scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers. The use of complex parameters allows users to drill down into the 
worksheet and customize data views through filters and slicers.
